#Purpose: This program will store an entire student database. Grades, notes, report cards, progress, academic offenses, and status will be all recorded. 
#The database will alert the user if a student is failing. A report card may be generated and saved to a text file named 'reportcard.txt'
#Metric data will also be available in the form of a graph for analysis
